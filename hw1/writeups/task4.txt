Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image to aid you in your explanation. One idea is to use a svg file that plots a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, which should produce a smoothly blended color triangle.

Barycentric coordinate is a coordinate system where any point in the system is a linear sum of vertices of a triangle. The coordinate will have all positive values if the point is enclosed within the triangle. To see this, observe the following triangle. Each vertex is assigned a color. And the color is mapped as a linear sum based on the value of the barycentric coordinate. Observe that the vertex themselves are purely their color, but as we move away from any vertex, the color becomes blended between 2 to 3 vertex colors.
